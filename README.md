# Digit_recognition
Automatic digit recognition is of popular interest today. Deep Learning techniques makes it possible for object recognition in image data.The data set used for this project is from the populat MNIST data set. Developed by Yann LeCun, Corina Cortes and Christopher Burger for evaluating machine learning model on the handwritten digit classification problem. It is a widely used data set in the machine learning community.We have total 70,000 images, out of which 49,000 are part of train images with the label of digit and rest 21,000 images are unlabeled (known as test images).Dataset used is available at https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-identify-the-digits/#ProblemStatement.
